paragraph:
- Some scientists are playing with their food to study a very old set of beliefs.
- The beliefs are not about God, they are not about family.
- The beliefs are about dropped food.
- For a very long time, humans shared a belief about dropping food on the floor.
- They thought it could be safe to eat, but only if it was picked up in less than five seconds.
- They called it the five-second rule. People just believed it.
- Of course, that's not always true.
