layout: revealjs-mini-thesis
paragraph:
- "It will be no great surprise to mothers that a new study confirms that moms (and mums) get less sleep than fathers."
- "Researchers in the USA analyzed data on the sleeping habits of 5,800 men and women."
- "They wanted to find out what affects adults' sleep. They found that having children in the house leads to less sleep for many mothers."
- "Motherhood greatly reduces the number of hours a mother sleeps. Unsurprisingly, this had an adverse effect on her energy levels during the day."
- "The study found that fathers' sleep remained largely unaffected by having kids in the house."
